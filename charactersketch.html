When she was young, Durvasa, told her a mantra through which she could call any Deva and have a child by him. She didn't believe it, so she tried to use it. Surya appeared but could not go without completing his task. Kunti put the child (Karna) in a basket in a river and abandoned it. She married Pandu, Prince of Hastinapur. He could not father children. Kunti then used her mantra, receiving her second son Yudhisthir from the God Dharma, then came Bheem from the God Vayu, then came Arjun from the God Indra. Kunti revealed the mantra to Pandu's second wife Madri, who bore twin sons, Nakul and Sahdev from the twin Gods Asvins.</p>
